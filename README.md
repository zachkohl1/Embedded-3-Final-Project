# Embedded-3
Includes all relevant files for my final embedded-3 lab. The following files use an Intel DE10-Lite FPGA to control the peripherals on a custom MSOE-developed peripheral board. The LT24 touchscreen display is communicated with through SPI serial. The accelerometer and camera modules (both are unused) are communicated with I2C serial. The game uses the joystick controller to move a player box to a horizontal line at the bottom of the screen. Enemies are spawned at random locations and move to the user. If the user touches any enemies, they lose and restart at the first level after a 5 second delay (shown in the 7-seg displays). There are 5 total levels with the finish line progressively moving closer to the bottom and with more enemies spawning (+5/lvl).
